A star, she shines silver white
She was stolen from the endless night 
Where dusk light sings to mist drowned tree
She shines lightless in the veiled sea

The lions roar frozen in twilight 
Listen the lament of a mothers heart piece
Souls shaking and choking from blight 
Start the sand wheel, fall free from freeze 

She walks alone watched by phantom eyes
Dance after her through the night 
Guiding hand of the nightingales cries
Bring home her long faded light
